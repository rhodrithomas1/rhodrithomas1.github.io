    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my little corner of the cosmos! I’m Rhodri Thomas—a stargazer, amateur astrophotographer, and software tinkerer.  
      This site is where I share my latest deep-sky images, showcase the tools I’ve built to plan and process them, and experiment with dark-mode web design inspired by the night sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the hood it’s a simple static site hosted on GitHub Pages, styled with a custom dark theme and built by hand in HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.  
      Every photo in the “Astro Photos” gallery is captured through my backyard setup, while the “Projects” page is where I dive into code—like my DeepSkyScout app for horizon-aware imaging planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re here to browse nebulae or peek at my source code, thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore, star my projects on GitHub, or drop me a note if you want to chat about telescopes, Python, or web design under the stars!
